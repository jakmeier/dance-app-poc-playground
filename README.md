# Bouncy Feet: Lab Prototype

Here be dragons.

The code inside this repository is not meant for human consumption. It's a bunch
of scripts to test out how well live motion detection works for shuffle dance
and how this feels inside a web app.

The only purpose of this is to facilitate product research before building the
real thing.

## Run it locally 

Something like this should work if everything is installed.

```
npm run watch
```

## Deploy it somewhere

```
npm run build
scp -r dist/* my-server:/host/path/
```
